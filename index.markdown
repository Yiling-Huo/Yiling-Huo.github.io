<p>I worked briefly as a research assistant at East China Normal University, in <a href="https://slangscience.github.io/slang/index_cn.html" target="_blank">Prof. Qing Cai‘s group</a>, where I worked with academic staff and Ph.D. students on several research projects involving reading eye-tracking, L2 acquisition, and brain development.</p>
<p>I am currently a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/linguistics/linguistics-people" target="_blank">Linguistics at UCL</a>, working with my supervisor <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/people/wingyee-chow" target="_blank">Dr. Wing-Yee Chow</a> on prediction during language comprehension.</p>
