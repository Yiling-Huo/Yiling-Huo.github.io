Dear students,

We are conducting an eye-tracking experiment about Mandarin Chinese and are recruiting participants. In this study, participants will be asked to listen to Mandarin Chinese sentences and answer simple comprehension questions, while their eye movements are recorded. 
 
The participant has to: 

- Speak Mandarin Chinese natively. 
- Have no other native languages (did not live in non-Mandarin-speaking countries or regions before the age of 7). 
- Have no dialects spoken more than Mandarin. 
- Have no known neurological disorders. 
- Have normal or corrected-to-normal eye-sight and hearing. 

This study will take place **in-person** at Chandler House, 2 Wakefield Street, London WC1N 1PF. It will be approximately **65 minutes** and you will be given **1.5 credits or Â£10** for participation. ***Please note that credits are only available for BSc Psychology students as part of their programme requirement***. BSc Psychology students can also choose monetary compensation in stead of credits.
