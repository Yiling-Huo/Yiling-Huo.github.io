This is what I did to build my personal website using Github Pages and Jekyll. 

The advantage of Github Pages and Jekyll is that it's free and quite easy to set up. There are also tons of free themes you can use to make your website pleasant to look at. 

In this tutorial, I will help you set up your personal website step-by-step. There are loads of website building tutorials out there, but I still wrote this one because I find many tutorials assume the reader has some knowledge of website building. In this tutorial, I will assume you have no prior knowledge of website developing or any programming language.

### **Step 1: Set up Github Pages** <a name="step1"></a>

The first thing we need to do is set up Github Pages. 

#### Go to www.github.com and register an account. 

Github is an internet hosting service for all kinds of coding. You will probably find it useful for other purposes, too!

![register github](/images/website_tutorial/signup_github.png)

#### After registering, go to your github page and create a new repository.

<img src="/images/website_tutorial/new_repo1.png" width="80%" height="80%">

On the create new repository page, you must **name your repository with \<your user name\>.github.io**. Naming your repository this way will allow Github to know this is a repository for Github Pages, Github's site hosting service. If you have capical letters in your unser name, those need to be in lower case. (My repository already exists, so there is an error.) 

While creating your repository, select 'Add a README file'.

<img src="/images/website_tutorial/new_repo2.png" width="80%" height="80%">

### **Step 2: Pull repository for local editing** <a name="step2"></a>

Next, we will need to pull the Github repository to a local directory.

#### Go to https://gitforwindows.org/ and download Git for Windows.

Git for Windows allows you to use the version control system Git on the Windows operating system. In other words, it will allow you to download your Github repository to your local directory, edit things locally, and upload your local directory to your Github repository. 

While installing Git for Windows, we don't need to change any settings. 

![install git](/images/website_tutorial/install_git.png)

After installing, go to your list of apps, open Git GUI, and select Clone Existing Repository.

![git gui](/images/website_tutorial/gitgui1.png)

![git clone](/images/website_tutorial/clone_repo1.png)

Go to your Github repository, copy the url, and paste to Source Location in Git GUI. Write down your target local directory in Target Directory. Note that your local directory **must not already exist**. Then click Clone.

![copy repo](/images/website_tutorial/clone_repo2.png)

![git clone3](/images/website_tutorial/clone_repo3.png)

After cloning, your local directory should have been created. Inside, you will find a hidden folder named .git, and your README file. 

![local folder](/images/website_tutorial/local_folder.png)

### **Step 3: Install Jekyll** <a name="step3"></a>

Next, we need to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is a static site generator, written in Ruby. On Windows, go to [Jekyll on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/) and follow the steps:

#### First, go to [RubyIntaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and download and install Ruby + Devkit 3.1.3.

![download ruby](/images/website_tutorial/ruby1.png)

#### At the last stage of installation wizard, select the Run 'ridk install' option.

![run ridk](/images/website_tutorial/ridk.png)

#### Then, enter option 3: MSYS2 and MINGW developmenttt toolchai

![run ridk2](/images/website_tutorial/ridk2.png)

After installing MSYS2 and MINGW development toolchain, press ENTER to exit. 

![run ridk3](/images/website_tutorial/ridk3.png)

open another command prompt, run `gem install jekyll bundler`.

![jekinstall](/images/website_tutorial/jekinstall.png)

Jekyll should be installed. Run `jekyll -v` to check if Jekyll is properly installed. Properly installed, the message should show current Jekyll version.

![jekv](/images/website_tutorial/jekv.png)

### **Step 4: Initialise website using Jekyll** <a name="step4"></a>

#### Search for 'cmd' in your Start menu to open a command prompt.

![cmd](/images/website_tutorial/cmd.png)

#### In the command prompt, go to your local directory for your website (the one we just cloned from Github).

Upon opening a command prompt, you will be located to one of your local drives. If your directory is not in the same drive, simply put `<Drive>:` in the command line (then press enter) to move to the correct drive.

Then, type `cd <your directory>` to go to your directory.

![cd](/images/website_tutorial/cd.png)

#### Run `jekyll new --skip-bundle . --force` to initialise your website. 

![initialise](/images/website_tutorial/initialise.png)

After initialising, you should see these files in your folder:

![after initialising](/images/website_tutorial/initialise2.png)

Some very important files for your website are (from [Samuel Flender's tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-launch-your-personal-website-with-github-pages-and-jekyll-7b653db43ec0)):

- `Gemfile` contains the gem dependencies required to execute Jekyll,
- `_config.yml` is the Jekyll configuration, which determines how your site will look like, and
- `index.md` is the homepage of your website. This is where youâ€™ll add your first content.

We will need to make some small changes to make sure the website runs smoothly with Github Pages.

Inside the `Gemfile`, comment out this line:

```Ruby 
#gem "jekyll", "~> 4.2.2"
```

And add these two lines:

```Ruby 
gem "github-pages", "~> 227", group: :jekyll_plugins
gem "webrick", "~> 1.8"
```

To open the Gemfile, simple right click and select open with any text editor (Notepad, for example). To comment out simply means to put a '#' at the beginning of the line. Your Gemfile should look like this:

![gemfile1](/images/website_tutorial/gemfile1.png)

Then, inside the `_config.yml`, comment out these two lines:

```Ruby
#baseurl: "" 
#url: ""
```
![config1](/images/website_tutorial/congig.png)

We won't need these because Github Pages will automatically set these urls.

Lastly, in the command prompt, run `bundle install`:

![bundle install](/images/website_tutorial/bundle.png)

This will install all the needed dependencies (gems).

### **Step 5: Edit your website** <a name="step5"></a>

#### Let's first take a look of the initial website Jekyll has created for us.

In the command prompt, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

This will generate a local url for your website. Copy the url to a browser and take a look:

![jekyll serve](/images/website_tutorial/serve.png)
<p>
</p>
![initial page](/images/website_tutorial/page.png)

We have a home page made using Jekyll's default theme, called `minima`. It's a minimalist theme suitable for many purposes. In the `home` layout, as we are seeing here, we have a header that navigates around our website, some content (empty for now), a module that shows all of our posts (for now, we have the auto-generated example post), and a footer of our website information. 

#### Now, let's try editing this page.

To edits the elements shown on the page, we need to open `_config.yml` and `index.markdown`. 

Inside `_config.yml`, notice these variables:
![congig2](/images/website_tutorial/congig2.png)

Edit these variables to edit the header and footers. Note that any changes to `_config.yml` will require re-running `bundle exec jekyll serve` to take effect.

Page files such as `index.markdown` have two main components, the YAML header and the content. The YAML header is enclosed in triple dashes on either side. Inside the YAML header, you can set values for various variables for your page. For now, the only variable specified is `layout:`. We can add more variables such as `title:` or `permalink:` for other pages. The home page does not need a `permalink:`. 

After the YAML, we can simply add some content to be shown on the home page. Because this is a markdown file, we can use both [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [html syntax](https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/ClearPass/CPGuest_UG_HTML_6.5/Content/Reference/BasicHTMLSyntax.htm#:~:text=HTML%20is%20a%20markup%20language,example%2C%20.). 

For example, to make my text bold, I can simply put `**text**`. 

I have made some changes two these two files and the website now looks like this: 

![congig3](/images/website_tutorial/congig3.png)
![index file](/images/website_tutorial/index1.png)
![page2](/images/website_tutorial/page2.png)

#### You may find it easier to edit markdown files in an editor app, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for example. 

### **Step 6: Adding a new page** <a name="step6"></a>

To add a new page, simply create a new markdown file. To do this without an editor app, simple right click - New - Text Document, and remember to change the extension to `.md`. 

For example, I have created `new_page.md` and it looks like this:

![new page](/images/website_tutorial/newpage.png)
![new page2](/images/website_tutorial/newpage2.png)

You can take a look of [my pages](https://yiling-huo.github.io/) that I created using these steps. 

### **Step 7: Change the theme** <a name="step7"></a>

There are many free [Jekyll themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) you can use. 

#### If the theme exists on Github, you can simply clone the theme's repository, edit, and push to your repository. 

Do not forget to credit the theme creators!

[To push a local directory to a different repository](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5181845/git-push-existing-repo-to-a-new-and-different-remote-repo-server)

### **Step 8: Deploy your page** <a name="step8"></a>

After editing your pages locally, you need to deploy the pages to Github Pages.

#### In a command prompt, run these lines (one by one):

For "notes", write down a brief description of what you have done with the files, for example "initial build".

```
git add .
git commit -m "notes"
git push origin master
```

This will create a new branch called 'master' in your repository, and upload everything in your local directory.

![push](/images/website_tutorial/push.png)

#### On Github, in your repository, go to Settings - Pages - Branch.

Select the branch you just pushed to (master), and save.

![push2](/images/website_tutorial/setting.png)

Under Actions, you should see that Github is trying to build the website. **When the orange dot turns green. Your website is ready!**

![action](/images/website_tutorial/action.png)

**Now everyone can access your website using your url /<your user name/>.github.io.**

#### Have some patience, and have fun!
