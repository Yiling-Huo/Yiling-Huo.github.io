Scripts and resources that I have created or modified. 

## Praat scripts:

- Make auditory serial presentation stimuli:

  <a href="/files/resources/praat/auditory-SP-stimuli-from-textgrid" download>Download</a>. [Tutorial](https://yiling-huo.github.io/tutorials/2023/03/10/make-auditory-SP-stimuli.html). A Praat script that given the stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA), makes auditory serial presentation stimuli from continuous speech recordings and their textgrids.
  
- Extract pitch contour:

  <a href="/files/resources/praat/extract_pitch_contour" download>Download</a>. [Tutorial](https://yiling-huo.github.io/tutorials/2023/03/10/extract-tone.html). A Praat script that extracts pitch contour information based on `.wav` sounds and `.Textgrid` files.

## Python scripts:

- Automated processing of Chinese cloze responses:

  <a href="/files/resources/python/chinese-cloze.zip" download>Download</a>. [Tutorial](https://yiling-huo.github.io/tutorials/2023/02/06/How-to-process-cloze.html). Two scripts that process data collected from cloze tasks in Chinese. In a cloze task, the participant sees incomplete sentences and is asked to complete the sentence by providing one or a few words.

## R scripts:

- Remove outliers:

  <a href="/files/resources/r/remove_outlier_function.R" download>Download</a>. A simple function that removes outliers from a data frame based on the 3s.d. rule.
