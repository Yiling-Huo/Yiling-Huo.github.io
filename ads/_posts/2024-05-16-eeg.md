## Description

This study investigates how native English speakers comprehend language. In this study, you will be asked to read English sentences on a computer screen and do some simple tasks using the keyboard. Meanwhile, your neural responses will be recorded using electroencephalography (EEG).

During data collection, small sensors are attached to your scalp to pick up the electrical signals produced by the brain. You will wear a cap that helps us locate where to put the sensors, and some gel will be applied to your scalp to help the sensors pick up better signals. You'll have a chance to wash and dry your hair after the experiment. The EEG procedure is painless, comfortable and very safe. No electricity is put into your body while it's carried out. Apart from having messy hair and possibly feeling a bit tired, you normally will not experience any side effects. 

Our experiment will be up to 2h, and you will be given £18 for your participation. 

The experiment will take place **in person** in Chandler House, 2 Wakefield Street, WC1N 1PF. Please meet the experimenter at the reception. The building is very close to the Brunswick shopping centre. Directions and a map can be found [here](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/maps/chandler-house). Please **wash your hair the day before the experiment** and **do not wear facial makeup on the day of the experiment**. Or you can remove your make-up before the experiment. It is ok to wear contact lenses or glasses. Any questions, please email yiling.huo.18@ucl.ac.uk.
