<p style="padding: 5em 0 1em 0;"><h2>About me</h2></p>

<p>Having finished my MSc and started my PhD at UCL, I’m still new to the world of research. There isn’t much on these pages now, but I’ll do my best to fill it with my work!</p>

<p>My journey to research is only possible with the support of my dear family, my friends, and my very supportive supervisors.</p>

<p>I worked briefly as a research assistant at East China Normal University, in <a href="https://slangscience.github.io/slang/index_cn.html" target="_blank">Prof. Qing Cai‘s group</a>, where I worked with academic staff and Ph.D. students on several research projects involving reading eye-tracking, L2 acquisition, and brain development.</p>

<p>I am currently a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/linguistics/linguistics-people" target="_blank">Linguistics at UCL</a>, working with my supervisor <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/people/wingyee-chow" target="_blank">Dr. Wing-Yee Chow</a> on prediction during language comprehension.</p>

<p>You can check out my <a href="https://yiling-huo.github.io/cv/">CV</a> and my <a href="https://yiling-huo.github.io/publications/">publications</a>. I also share some of workflow and some scripts I created on my <a href="https://yiling-huo.github.io/tutorials/" target="_blank">tutorials</a> and <a href="https://yiling-huo.github.io/resources/" target="_blank">resources</a> pages. You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/YlHuo" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, or contact me by <a href="mailto:yiling.huo.18@ucl.ac.uk">email</a>.
